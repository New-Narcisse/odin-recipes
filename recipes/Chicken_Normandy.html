    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can button mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Pan-sear chicken breasts in the hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. 
            Remove chicken breasts from the skillet.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add drained mushrooms to the pan juices in the skillet and cook until they start to pop, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together cream, egg yolk, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; 
            pour into the skillet with the mushrooms. Return chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer 
            over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the egg yolk from setting, 
            until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken 
            breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with cooked white rice.</p></li>

    </ol>
